    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
       To give context to this project, the definition of baptism is this: “Baptism is the initiatory sign by which [Christians] are admitted to the fellowship of the church, that being engrafted into Christ [they] may be accounted children of God. Moreover, the end for which God has given it…is, first, that it may be conducive to [their] faith in him; and, secondly, that it may serve the purpose of a confession among men…” (Calvin and Beveridge, 859). 
<br>Baptism has been a standard doctrine at the heart of Christianity since the dawn of the religion. Therefore, it is not the doctrine itself, but rather the practice and mode of the sacrament that has debated for many centuries by biblical scholars. 
<br>To give fuller definition of this project’s terms, Credobaptism is the position that states only people that are believers are to be baptized. Credobaptists affirm “repentance and faith as constitutive for the act of baptism” (George). On the other hand, Pedobaptists believe that infants may be baptized (with qualifications). Gerhard Forde, a pedobaptist who is not reformed nonetheless sets forth the logic of the belief clearly: “…The question is not whether we can prove theologically that infants must be included, but whether there are unimpeachable theological grounds for excluding them, not whether we must, but whether we may baptize infants…” Pedobaptists believe there are numerous reasons that infants should be included in the practice of baptism.
<br>So far, there has been no research so far on either “side’s” conceptions of the other’s beliefs, all the work that has been done has been mostly theological scholarship.
