    <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
In this project I will research the questions: What is the Credobaptist understanding of baptism? What is the Credobaptist understanding of infant baptism? How is infant baptism characterized by “unschooled” Credobaptists? What are common misconceptions of Pedobaptism held and/or propagated by Credobaptists?
<br>In these explorations, I hope to investigate Credobaptist (particularly those without a seminary degree, who have not yet explored theological nuances, original languages, etc.) conceptions and representations of infant baptism. My hypothesis is that many “uneducated” Credobaptists have an uninformed or misinformed conception of the Pedobaptist perspective, leading to misrepresentations of it. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will suggest (among other things) that there is a lack of education and/or information surrounding the doctrine of Pedobaptism and important issues surrounding it in Credobaptist thought. If it is disconfirmed, it will suggest that Credobaptists have a robust and informed perspective on Pedobaptism, with Biblically sound reasoning against it. Either way, the aim of the project is to encourage the theologically and scholarly uninclined Christian to know the reasons why they believe what they believe, and to search the Bible diligently to know God deeper through the “means of grace”, particularly baptism.
