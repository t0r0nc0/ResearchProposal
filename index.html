    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The general subject of this research project is Christian baptism. While there is much to be researched of this topic, the particular area within the subject that will be researched is Credobaptist conceptions of reformed Pedobaptism. Baptism is a vital part of the Christian religion, yet there have been centuries of debate and disagreement about how it should be done. Moreover, in today’s day and age, many Christians adhere to a “side” without being fully informed of the alternatives.  
        <br>   
         This look into Credobaptist Conceptions of Reformed Pedobaptism may spark many things, including an interest in biblical exegesis, scholarly debate, encouragement for education on the doctrine of baptism, interest in the general topic, charity and unity amidst theological divisions, and doctrinal clarity for the (formally) “uneducated” lay-person.  
        <br>
        In this outline, “pedobaptism” refers to reformed pedobaptism, such that is practiced in presbyterian and reformed churches (as opposed to Catholic, Orthodox, or Methodist pedobaptism).
