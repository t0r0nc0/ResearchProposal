    <h2>Significance</h2>
      <p>
        This will be the first (as far as I know) research project of its type on the subject of baptism. I think it will also be the first investigation into the perspectives on baptism outside of academia. It will be the first study on (mis)representation for this subject as well. It would do the church well to have a study like this, so those who hold views on either side may be reminded to hold fast to their beliefs, while still loving their brothers and sisters. The exhibition of folly that may arise out of this project may work to humble those with strong convictions into open-mindedness and charity towards those whom they stand firm against. It will also give rich insight into how such perspectives are formed and communicated and what major influences are on credobaptist beliefs.
