    <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
I will conduct this project through the method of virtual ethnography. I am going to be studying representation and misrepresentation, so it makes the most sense for me to go to more informal sources for my data. Places like online chat rooms, public forums, and email newsletters are good places to start¬– the ideas shared on such platforms that I plan on being on (reddit, twitter, puritanboard, discord, etc.) are where people are most candid. Such platforms also have easy access to multimodal data; one may learn a lot more about representation in the real world from a meme than from a peer-reviewed article! I will test anybody who claims to be a credobaptist online, because they can obviously give me the best data on what credobaptist perspectives on paedobaptism are. 
<br>The sample that I would test would be internet users who claim to subscribe to a credobaptist conviction who are willing to share their perspectives online– beyond that, there are no specific demographics focus on, because I do not plan on conducting my research on a concentrated group of people (which would be very hard anyway due to high rates of online anonymity). I will not exclude any participant who meets these two criteria.
<h2>Procedures</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
<br>First, I will find online conversations about credobaptism and paedobaptism, and engage those conversations with the other participants. From there, after gaining consent, I will ask targeted questions around paedobaptism through an online questionnaire in their direct messages in order to get as full of a perspective as possible from them.
<br>The questionnaire will ask questions such as, “What does baptism mean to you?”, “How should baptism be practiced?”, “What are your thoughts regarding infant baptism?”, “Why do you believe other practices of baptism to be unbiblical?”. The answers to these questions as well as any data from existing conversations or posts will be collected for analysis.
<br>I will analyze my results by categorizing them into groups based on the medium they were collected in and code them according to themes that are organically exposed from the data set. From there I will compile these themes and outline what I believe the most common or notable perspectives on pedobaptism to be, and give my opinion on what this means for credobaptists, the baptism debate, and the church at large. A data set that exhibits misinformed perspectives on pedobaptism would confirm my hypothesis; a data set that exhibits misrepresentations of pedobaptism would do the same. A data set that exhibits informed conceptions of what pedobaptists believe and fair representations (not necessarily positive) would confirm my hypothesis. This data collection will take place for two or three months after IRB approval, followed by two months for analysis, totaling around six months for the whole research project.
